Bringing transparency in subsidy based governance using blockchain and IoT


Problem statement:
A great extent of time is wasted under supply chain and significant truthful beneficiaries are bereft of government subsidized schemes. Government subsidized items like fertilizers, housing schemes (Indira Awas,land etc.), pension schemes, medicines, rationing items (wheat,sugar,kerosene) enormous amount of time is wasted in supply chain and that results in wastage of huge amount of items, delayed delivery of the items etc. Also due to other various reasons in some cases subsidized items/schemes does not reaches to the truthful beneficiary. To address & ensure government schemes are reaching to the beneficiary in the timely manner, A Blockchain based ecosystem can be developed in order to monitor, track and ensure reduced supply chain time and desirable beneficiary is benefited under the government schemes.
