Bringing transparency in subsidy based governance using blockchain and IoT


Problem statement:
A great extent of time is wasted under supply chain and significant truthful beneficiaries are bereft of government subsidized schemes. Government subsidized items like fertilizers, housing schemes (Indira Awas,land etc.), pension schemes, medicines, rationing items (wheat,sugar,kerosene) enormous amount of time is wasted in supply chain and that results in wastage of huge amount of items, delayed delivery of the items etc. Also due to other various reasons in some cases subsidized items/schemes does not reaches to the truthful beneficiary. To address & ensure government schemes are reaching to the beneficiary in the timely manner, A Blockchain based ecosystem can be developed in order to monitor, track and ensure reduced supply chain time and desirable beneficiary is benefited under the government schemes.


our solution:

1. We’re building an AI network that predicts the future instead of reacting to the past. In addition to ensuring food/product quality, blockchain data could soon feed an AI solution that does everything from tracking inventory and predicting future demand to monitoring freezer conditions and anticipating future repairs or replacements.

2. The added transparency offers proof about how goods were sourced and how they comply with regulations. The physical, financial, and digital information is brought together in one platform to reveal sources of value leakage — from everyday inefficiencies to fraud and abuse — and helps you hone new strategies to combat them.

3. With blockchain-stored records, all relevant information can be simultaneously and securely available to sender, receiver, shipper, regulators and government. 

4. Delays involving weather, labor disputes or error are inevitable; blockchain-optimized processes help to resolve real-world issues. Knowing that a shipment is incomplete or at risk can instantly trigger remediation actions like supplier substitutions or price adjustments — before a crisis emerges.

5.With blockchain records that reflect a product’s geographic flow and how it was treated, you can examine sources, investigate industry certifications, track restricted or dangerous components, discover storage-condition anomalies and more. 

6.“At its most basic level, the core logic of blockchains means that no piece of inventory can exist in the same place twice.” Blockchains give these supply chain networks the chance to create one shared truth without one all-powerful, centralized intermediary. Each participant has a copy of the ledger, and all transactions and movements are part of that ledger. If any participant tries to game the system or perpetrate fraud, that company is manipulating only its ledger and is immediately out of sync with the rest of the ecosystem, a powerful deterrent to bad behavior. 

7. Using smart contracts, where the terms are payable upon receipt, a proof of delivery from a logistics carrier will immediately trigger automatic digital invoicing and payments through the banking system, with no analog gap between customer and supplier. The result has the potential to radically reduce working capital requirements and dramatically simplify finance operations, with a direct impact to the bottom line.


Major challenges faced by supply chains relate to information sharing and trust.
Blockchain and IoT offer bright opportunities to tackle these challenges. We have identified four challenges that the combination of IoT and blockchain will bring to supply chain management: 
Continuity of information: 
Accessibility to information: 
Link between physical and information flows:


Code of conduct violations and fraud detection By its intrinsic properties, an IoT-enabled blockchain can address these visibility and traceability challenges. Blockchain technology enables companies: to record every event or transaction within a supply chain on a distributed ledger. This ledger is shared among all participants, not owned by any, and records events transactions in a secure, immutable, and irrevocable way. Blockchain can be applied to many challenges of the Supply Chain industry such as complicated record keeping and tracking of products. As a less corruptible and better-automated alternative to centralised databases. Following are the ways in which blockchain can be useful in the supply chain industry. Provenance Tracking Cost Reduction Establishing Trust Other than these, few other benefits of adopting Blockchain technology in the supply chain industry are: Reduce or eliminate fraud and errors Improve inventory management Minimize courier costs Reduce delays from paperwork Identify issues faster Increase consumer and partner trust
